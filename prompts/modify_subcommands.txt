### Run subcommand
In run subcommand, i want to automatically progress everything.
- Receive optional argument '-n name' which should be used in cmakelists.txt (run should modify cmakelists.txt according to this argument)
- run subcommand should modify cmakelists.txt so that packages recorded in .libname are used by project

### Enhancing convenience
- Please update install, uninstall, run subcommand so that they can support,
- functionality such like -L, -l, -I in gcc/g++
- Which means such path and libname should be recorded in .libname and subcommand should modify cmakelists.txt according them
